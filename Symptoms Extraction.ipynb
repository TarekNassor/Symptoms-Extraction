    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to implement a text summarization model utilizing BERT for token classification to extract symptoms from text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "The project requires the following libraries:\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "- `nltk`\n",
    "- `contractions`\n",
    "- `transformers`\n",
    "- `datasets`\n",
    "- `torch`\n",
    "- `rouge_score`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps in the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - The `text_cleaner` function processes each post to remove stopwords, contractions, and special characters, resulting in a cleaned text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label Preparation**:\n",
    "   - The `prepare_labels` function generates labels based on the presence of negative words in the cleaned text. If a negative word is found, it marks the corresponding label and the preceding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Splitting**:\n",
    "   - The dataset is shuffled and split into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dataset Conversion**:\n",
    "   - The cleaned text and labels are converted into a format suitable for BERT training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - A BERT model for token classification is instantiated and trained using the Hugging Face `Trainer` API with defined training arguments. The model is saved for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extractive Summary Generation**:\n",
    "   - The `extractive_summary` function tokenizes input text and uses the trained model to identify and extract relevant sentences that contain negative sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - The ROUGE metric is used to evaluate the performance of the summarization model against reference summaries in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "The average ROUGE scores are computed to evaluate the effectiveness of the summarization model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To run the project:\n",
    "1. Install the required libraries.\n",
    "3. Execute the code in a Python environment with GPU support for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using BERT extractive summarization, providing insights into the emotional content of text data.\n",
    "g insights into the emotional content of text data.\r\n",
    "ing insights into the emotional content of text data.\r\n"
